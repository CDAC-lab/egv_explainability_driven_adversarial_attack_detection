actions to reduce he u s trade deficit reagan imposed the sanctions on april in retaliation for japan s failure to honor commitments to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than production costs and to open its own market to u s goods the sanctions were levied on certain japanese television sets personal computers and hand held power tools reagan in imposing the curbs said
